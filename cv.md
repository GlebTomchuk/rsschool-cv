# CV 

Hello. My name is Gleb. I am 22 years old. I have been working at the factory for almost 4 years, and during this time I realized that I don`t want to work there all my life. 

I like to learn new things, I like to program. I am purposeful, trainable, charged for a change of profession and achieve success in a new field.

I came to programming with a zero level of knowledge.

I don’t have an example code, because I haven’t worked in this area yet. But I really hope that soon there will be plenty of such examples.

***Work experiense***: 4 years at the factory,no programming experiense. 

***English level*** - A2+(PreIntermediate). Data obtained using the service _streamline_.

***Education***: 
   1. Secondary specialized in the specialty of a technician-mechanic. 
   2. Incomplete higher education in mechanical engineering (in the process of training).
***
